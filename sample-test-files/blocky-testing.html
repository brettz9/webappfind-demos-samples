<p>This proof-of-concept demo is meant to show how external Blockly code files (which can themselves be edited using the WebAppFind Blockly demo) can be referenced within an HTML file source, auto-converted into JavaScript by a single additional JavaScript file, and evaluated, thereby allowing newcomers the ability to preserve their exact Blockly code files (e.g., keeping their blocks' original x and y positions) along with the HTML files in which the converted code will be used and without the need for continually copy-pasting converted JavaScript code back to the page.</p>
<p>Although this proof-of-concept demo technically can work (minus the fact that it currently has an extra line of code to alert the resulting JavaScript code to demonstrate that it is retrieving and converting the Blockly code successfully), it won't be able to do anything useful unless Blockly itself is expanded to support Web APIs (if not objects, arbitrarily nested properties (with corresponding static or dynamic access), and arbitrary new and normal invocations).</p>
<p>In my view, an ideal demo would allow for a WYSIWYG HTML editor like CKEditor to integrate a web-enabled Blockly as a widget (in addition to SVG-edit as a widget) so that all aspects of web development could be put under graphical control and made available within an open source web app (which, via WebAppFind, can easily work on local files), thereby not only mimicking the word processing experience, but allowing for graphical scripting.</p>
